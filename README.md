How tp play the game :

Set up the game: Place the grid in a vertical position, so there are 7 columns and 6 rows. Each player selects their color (red or yellow).

Taking turns: Players take turns dropping one of their colored discs into any column of their choice. The disc will occupy the lowest available position in the chosen column.

Win condition: The game continues until one player successfully connects four of their discs in a row either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game ends immediately when this happens, and that player wins.

Draw: If the grid becomes completely filled with discs, and no player has achieved a four-in-a-row connection, the game is a draw.

Optional rules: Some variations of Connect 4 allow players to choose different grid sizes, and there are also advanced strategies that players can employ to try to win.

Remember that the key to winning Connect 4 is both offensive and defensive play. You need to form your own connections while also blocking your opponent from forming their own.
